                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>The topic that I decided to use for my data is games that I physically own. I used this as my topic 
                    because I like to collect them and keep track of things like their prices and condition. Also, my collection 
                    is a good mix of games I grew up playing and have always had, and games that I bought more recently, so I wanted to 
                    see if there was any pattern in my buying habits.

                <h2>Data Collection</h2>
                <p>  Because my data is based on games that I physically own, most of my data comes from going through 
                    each individual title and logging what platform they were on, the condition, and whether or not 
                    I've played the game. For prices I used <a href = 'https://pricecharting.com'>pricecharting.com</a> 
                    to find the current average price on eBay. I was also able to get some release years from the same website, 
                    but also used Wikipedia to be more specific in certain cases, such as finding the release year for the 
                    North American region.

                    <h2>Changes Made to Site</h2>
                    <p>
                        The two changes I made to my site after meeting with Jackie were changing the font family and size 
                        of text to be more readable, and changing one of my filters on the data table to a checkbox.
