                    <p>The filters for this table show more specific data that I've collected. Using the played filter together with 
                        other filters, it shows a better criteria to see what sorts of games I have and haven't played. For instance, 
                        the platforms with the least amount of games played are PS1 and PS2. Although this can be explained by the fact 
                        that I have more titles for these two platforms than any others, the percentage of played to not played is about half. 
                        Other platforms have a lower ratio of played and not played, which goes to show that I tend to buy more games for these 
                        older platforms but don't play them as much as I do newer platforms. The release year only proves this further - 
                        other than 2023's Final Fantasy XVI, the newest released games that I haven't played came out in 2012, showing 
                        that I lean more towards playing newer releases before older ones.
