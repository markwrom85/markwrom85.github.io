                        Pills of Hatred was a solo project for the GIMM 290 class. Two players fight against each other
                        to
                        pick up the most items. My main focus for this project was gameplay, as all of the assets were
                        found
                        for free on the Unity store. I wanted to make the game feel extremely fast paced, so in addition
                        to fast and tight movement,
                        I added a multiplier meter that increases as players pick up items and fight each other.

                        Lock Wizard was a group project for the GIMM 270 class. Throughout the game, players must pick
                        locks that have been placed by an evil wizard. My main focus for this project was creating the
                        lock picking minigame, which I wanted to create as close to real life lock picking as possible.
                        This was the first time that I worked with virtual reality, and I had fun figuring out how to
                        set up the minigame for VR.

                        Yummy Gun is the first project I created for the GIMM program. I did all of the art and
                        programming myself, using Unity, C#,
                        Photoshop, and Clip Studio Paint. My focus for this project was creating a more challenging
                        experience for the player while
                        incorporating elements from the story, so I added a fuel meter based around the idea of eating
                        leftover food floating around in space.

                        Picture Perfect is a 2D platformer where players use an AR camera to scan a painting, entering a
                        platforming level based on that painting. This was a group project for the GIMM 110 class, where
                        my main focus was on programming.
                        I learned how to utilize AR in this game, using the Vuforia package to set up AR functionality.
                        The video above is a retrospective
                        of the project with perspectives from each member of the team.

                        our own data and present it through various graphs and charts of our choosing. This project
                        was my first major website project, and I learned how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create
                        a website that presented my data. I also learned how to use D3.js and React to build
                        interactive graphs and charts.

                        Pig-Kid was a short scene I wrote, directed, and edited for the FILM 290 class. I worked in a
                        group of five,
                        and each week we would rotate who did what job. This specific scene was my first time writing
                        and directing a script,
                        but I also got experience with being Director of Photography, Mixer/Boom Operator, and acting
                        for my group-members scenes.
                        The video above is a final cut of my scene, which was also the first time I color graded a
                        video.
