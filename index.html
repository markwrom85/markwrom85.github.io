                <h1>Hello, I'm <span>Markus Rom</span>, an Interactive Media Developer</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is I'm Markus Rom, a sophomore at Boise State University majoring in Games, Interactive
                    Media,
                    and Mobile Technologies (GIMM) with a minor in Film and Television. I specialize in visual
                    storytelling,
                    game design, and programming. I have a passion for creating engaging and immersive experiences
                    through
                    interactive media, aiming to create engaging and memorable experiences.

                <h2>Pills of Hatred</h2>
                <p>Pills of Hatred is a local multiplayer game where players compete to score the most points.
                    Players run around an arena to pick up items to add to their score, and fighting each other lets
                    players gain
                    more points. Throughout this project, I learned how to set up a split-screen camera in Unity,
                    and how the camera
                    angles and camera controls used can affect the player experience. It was fun to create the
                    camera system, mainly
                    because it wasn't required of the project but it was something that I really wanted to learn how
                    to implement. I
                    also had a lot of fun creating the game's movement system, because I feel that the gameplay
                    encourages moving
                    around the arena quickly, and the movement is quick enough to feel like a good place. Also, the
                    movement was
                    very responsive to the player's input, allowing players to weave around obstacles.

                <h2>Lock Wizard</h2>
                <p>Lock Wizard is a game created for the Meta Quest 2. Throughout the game, there is an evil wizard
                    who locks the
                    player up, and the player must pick the lock to get out. This project was done in a group of 4,
                    and my main
                    focus was creating the lock picking minigame. To create the minigame, I researched how to pick
                    locks and figured
                    out how best to adapt that into a virtual reality game. Figuring out how to set up that minigame
                    and then
                    applying it to virtual reality was a really fun experience, as I had never worked with virtual
                    reality before.

                <h2>Yummy Gun</h2>
                <p>This was the first project I created for the GIMM program, and the first game I ever made. The
                    gameplay of Yummy
                    Gun is a side-scrolling shooter, where players must dodge incoming bullets and obstacles while
                    they shoot at
                    enemies. My favorite part of this project was creating a fuel meter, because I feel it adds more
                    challenge to
                    the gameplay systems. As the player progresses through the level, they must pick up items to add
                    to their fuel,
                    otherwise they get a game over. Trying to find a good balance between having too much fuel and
                    not enough that
                    it became too challenging was a fun experience to test through.

                <h2>Picture Perfect</h2>
                <p>Picture Perfect is a 2D platformer that has the player going through a level that is based on a
                    painting.
                    The game uses AR as its basis, having players scan the the painting to unlock the level.
                    Although the
                    platforming
                    section is not directly on the painting being scanned through AR, the level uses the painting as
                    a background
                    and
                    the basis for the level design. I was one of the programmers on this project, and learned how to
                    use AR to set
                    the project up. We used the Vuforia package to set it up, and I learned how to utilize AR
                    technology to create
                    this game.

                <h2>Mobile Data Narrative</h2>
                <p>The Mobile Data Narrative is a class project where we each had to individually gather
                    our own data and present it through various graphs and charts of our choosing. This project 
                    was my first major website project, and I learned how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create
                    a website that presented my data. I also learned how to use D3.js and React to build
                    interactive graphs and charts.
