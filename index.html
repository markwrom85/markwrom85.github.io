    <p>Hello, I’m Markus Rom, an aspiring game developer and student at Boise State University majoring in
        Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technologies (GIMM). Through my class experiences,
        I have become skilled at using Unity, C#, and the Adobe Suite to create various interactive experiences.

    <h2>Pills of Hatred</h2>
    <p>Pills of Hatred is a local multiplayer game where players compete to score the most points.
        Players run around an arena to pick up items to add to their score, and fighting each other lets players gain
        more points. Throughout this project, I learned how to set up a split-screen camera in Unity, and how the camera
        angles and camera controls used can affect the player experience. It was fun to create the camera system, mainly
        because it wasn’t required of the project but it was something that I really wanted to learn how to implement. I
        also had a lot of fun creating the game’s movement system, because I feel that the gameplay encourages moving
        around the arena quickly, and the movement is quick enough to feel like a good place. Also, the movement was
        very responsive to the player’s input, allowing players to weave around obstacles.

    <h2>Lock Wizard</h2>
    <p>Lock Wizard is a game created for the Meta Quest 2. Throughout the game, there is an evil wizard who locks the
        player up, and the player must pick the lock to get out. This project was done in a group of 4, and my main
        focus was creating the lock picking minigame. To create the minigame, I researched how to pick locks and figured
        out how best to adapt that into a virtual reality game. Figuring out how to set up that minigame and then
        applying it to virtual reality was a really fun experience, as I had never worked with virtual reality before.

    <h2>Yummy Gun</h2>
    <p>This was the first project I created for the GIMM program, and the first game I ever made. The gameplay of Yummy
        Gun is a side-scrolling shooter, where players must dodge incoming bullets and obstacles while they shoot at
        enemies. My favorite part of this project was creating a fuel meter, because I feel it adds more challenge to
        the gameplay systems. As the player progresses through the level, they must pick up items to add to their fuel,
        otherwise they get a game over. Trying to find a good balance between having too much fuel and not enough that
        it became too challenging was a fun experience to test through.

    <h2>Picture Perfect</h2>
    <p>Picture Perfect is a 2D platformer that has the player going through a level that is based on a painting.
        The game uses AR as its basis, having players scan the the painting to unlock the level. Although the platforming 
        section is not directly on the painting being scanned through AR, the level uses the painting as a background and 
        the basis for the level design. I was one of the programmers on this project, and learned how to use AR to set 
        the project up. We used the Vuforia package to set it up, and I learned how to utilize AR technology to create this game.
